Arica: This file stores the arrays for each tutorial in the Social Media category. Each array is a summary of one tutorial, and each string value in the array represents one bullet point of that tutorial's summary.
 
    I have left MARK comments in this file to provide quick jump links to each tutorial.

    Arica: IMPORTANT NOTE! Because the Internet tutorials category also has a "Creating Accounts" tutorial, this tutorial is specified with "Social Media" in the middle of the array name. This is only for providing the arrays with different names. The lists of Internet and Social Media tutorials are not going to be altered to have different names.
